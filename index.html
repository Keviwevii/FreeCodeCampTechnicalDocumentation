            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="intro-p">JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming
                language with
                first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-brower environments also use it, such as <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Apache CouchDB</b> and <b>Adobe
                    Acrobat</b>. JavaScript is a
                prototype-based, multi-paridigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                imperative, and declarative(e.g functional programming) styles.</p>
            <div class="intro">
                <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                    trademarks
                    or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming
                    languages have a very different syntax, semantic, and use. JavaScript is versatile and
                    beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D
                    graphics,
                    comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

                    JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of
                    tools
                    on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum
                    effort.
                    These include:</p>
                <ul class="intro-list">
                    <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing
                        functionality
                        such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video
                        stream
                        from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                    <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content
                        providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
                    <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of
                        building
                        sites and applications.</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less
                recommended) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable you can also give it a
                value:</p>
            <code>let myName = "Kevin";</code>
            <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in your code.</p>
            <code>let myVariable = "Kevin";<br>myVariable = "Floyd";</code>
            <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>
            <br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Variable</th>
                    <th>Explanation</th>
                    <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="first-data">String</td>
                    <td>This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string enclose it
                        single quote marks</td>
                    <td><code>let myName = "Kev";</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="first-data">Number</td>
                    <td>This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</td>
                    <td><code>let myFavNum = 14;</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="first-data">Boolean</td>
                    <td>This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote
                        marks.</td>
                    <td><code>let myChoice = true;</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="first-data">Array</td>
                    <td>This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</td>
                    <td><code>let myArray = ['Kevin','Floyd',14,22];<br> Refer to each member of the <br>array like this: myArray[0],myArray[1], etc.</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="first-data">Array</td>
                    <td>This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable
                        Keep this in mind as you learn.</td>
                    <td><code>let myObject = document.querySelector('h1');<br> All of the above examples too.</code>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <p>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values
                couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an
                image displayed in an image gallery.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="comments">
            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as
                comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
            <code>/*<br>Everything in between is a comment.<br>*/</code>
            <p>If your comment has no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this: </p>
            <code>// This is a comment</code>
            <br><br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="operators">
            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol which produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the
                following table you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the
                JavaScript console.</p>

                <tr>
                    <th>Operator</th>
                    <th>Explanation</th>
                    <th>Symbol</th>
                    <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class='first-data'>Addition</td>
                    <td>Add two numbers together or combine two strings.</td>
                    <td>+</td>
                    <td><code>10+10;<br>'Lady' + 'Gaga!';</code></td>
                </tr>

                    <td class='first-data'>Subtraction,<br>Multiplication,<br>Division</td>

                    <td class='first-data'>Assignment</td>
                    <td>As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable.</td>
                    <td>=</td>
                    <td>let myName = 'Kev';</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class='first-data'>Equality</td>
                    <td>This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.
                    </td>
                    <td>===</td>
                    <td><code>let myNum = 1;<br>myNum === 2;</code></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class='first-data'>Not, Does-not-equal</td>
                    <td>This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false,
                        etc..
                        When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values
                        are
                        not equal.</td>
                    <td>!,!==</td>
                    <td>For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate it:
                        <br><br><code>let myNum = 1;<br>!(myNum === 1);</code><br><br>"Does-not-equal" gives basically
                        the same result
                        with different syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable NOT equal to 3". This returns false
                        because myVariable IS equal to 3: <br><br><code>let myNum = 1; <br> myNum !== 1;</code></td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="conditionals">
            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of
                conditionals is the if ... else statement. For example:</p>
            <code>let dogName = 'Champion';<br>if(dogName === 'Champion'){<br>&emsp;&emsp;alert('I love Parks & Rec!');<br>} else {<br>&emsp;&emsp;alert('I like your dogs name.');<br>}</code>
            <p>The expression inside the if( ... ) is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above) to
                compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison
                returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of
                code—after the else statement—runs instead.</p>
            <br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="functions">
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possibel to define a body of
                code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good
                alternative to repeated;y writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions
                previously. For example:</p>
            <code> let myFunctionExample = document.querySelector('h1');</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            <code>alert('hello!');</code>
            <p>If you see something that looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses it is likely a
                function. Functions often take arguments. Arguments are bits of data they need to do their job.
                Arguments go inside the parentheses, seperated by a commas if there is more that one argument.</p>
            <p>For example, the <b>alert()</b> function makes a pop-up appear inside the browser window, but we need to
                give it a string as an argument to tell the function what to display.</p>
            <p>You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function that takes two
                numbers as arguments and adds them: </p>
            <code>function add(num1,num2){<br>&emsp;&emsp;let result = num1 * num2;<br>&emsp;&emsp;return result;<br>}</code>
            <p>We can run this in the console, and test different arguments:</p>
            <code>add(5,10);<br>add(10,15);<br>add(15,20);<br></code>
            <br>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="events">
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These code structures listen for activity in the
                browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is ahndling the click event, which is fired
                by the browser when you click on something with the mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following in
                to your console, then click on the current webpage.</p>
            <code>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function(){<br>&emsp;&emsp;alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');<br>}</code>
            <p>There are many ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the html element, setting
                its onclick property equal to an anonymous(i.e. nameless function, which contains the code we want the
                click event to run.<br><br>Note that</p>
            <code>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {};</code>
            <p>is equivalent to</p>
            <code>let myHTML = document.querySelector('html');<br>myHTML.onclick = function() {};</code>
            <p>It is just shorter.</p>
